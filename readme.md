# Loonie-Backend

This repo is the flask server deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk for use as an intermediary between the [Loonie front-end](https://itsjafer.com/loonie) and Plaid API.

In particular, this intermediary ensures that all secret keys are kept hidden from the [client](https://itsjafer.com/loonie) at all times.
